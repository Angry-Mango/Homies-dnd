    <h2 id="deitiesaelfir">The Solar Pantheon, Deities of the Aelfir</h2>
<h3 id="deitiesaelfir">FATHER SUMMER, OR FATHER PLENTY, OR SUNLIGHT'S-ETERNAL-VIGOR
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Ideals: Strength, Vitality, Growth, and Feasts</li>
    <li>Gifts: Father gave the aelfir their ability to withstand cold temperatures, their long lives, and their tall, graceful forms.
    </li>
    <li>Personality: Father is seen as good-natured and welcoming, and many festivals and feasts are held in his honor.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deitiesaelfir">MOTHER WINTER, OR MOTHER MANY, OR SHIFTING-ETERNAL-BLESSING</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Ideals: Control, Mastery, Change, and Precision
    </li>
    <li>Gifts: Mother gave the aelfir their mastery of the world and of their physical forms, and their power over temperature and ice that lets them control the climate in Amaranth (their homeland).
    </li>
    <li>Personality: Mother is seen as a scrupulous guardian of the aelfir, steering the sun through the sky so that it lengthens summers and shortens winters.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deitiesaelfir">BROTHER AUTUMN, OR BROTHER HARVEST, OR SCYTHES-CULL-THE-WEEPING
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Ideals: Perfection, Knowledge, Harvest, and Brevity
    </li>
    <li>Gift:Brother gave aelfir their harvest, their appetite, and their death.
    </li>
    <li>Personality: Most would describe Brother as cruel: the aelfir describe him with a word that translates as “perfect”.
    </li>
    <li>Conflict: The popularity of undying surgery within the aelfir community rubs against tenets of belief espoused by Brother Harvet, and as such the sects devoted to him have been driven underground and into radicalism.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deitiesaelfir">SISTER SPRING, OR SISTER-SUNLIGHT, OR GLOWING-MELTS-THE-ICE</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Ideals: Fire, Clarity, Beauty, and Rebirth</li>
    <li>Gift: Sister gave aelfir gain their artistry and perfect beauty.
    </li>
    <li>Personality: Scholars and artists alike devote themselves to Sister because of her uncanny, unparalleled beauty and grace.
    </li>
    <li>Conflict: After centuries awaiting Sister to melt the everfrost, an eternal ice that resides beneath Amaranth, her avatar instead followed the pilgrimage of the aelfir into Najfielle with her brother. While the aelfir of Najfielle extol Sister Spring for this reason, those remaining in Amaranth consider her an apostate.</li>

    <h2>The Lunar Pantheon, Deities of the Drow
    </h2>
    <div id="border">
        <h3 id="deitiesdrow">HEMOLYCK, OR MARTYRED GOD (they/them)
        </h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Ideals: Sacrifice, Diplomacy, Justice, and Sympathy.</li>
        <li>Lore: Hemolyck was slayed by brother Autumn and Sister Spring when the god attempted to stop the aelfir's subjugation of the drow diplomatically. They can be found cocooned within the Red Moon, its blood coat a result of their gruesome metamorphosis</li>
    <li>Rituals: Red saints will detonate suicide firebombs in hopes of avenging Hemolyck and entering the Red Moon to save them.</li>
    <li>Polotics: Hemolyck is a martyr of the red saints, a rebellious sect of drow who are at constant war with the aelfir to reclaim their homeland.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 id="deitiesdrow">SLUMBOUS, OR WIDOWED LADY (she/her)</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Ideals: Melancholy, Healing, Repose, and Faith</li>
    <li>Lore: Slumbous was once married to Hemolyck before her loveperson died. She resides in the Moon Garden, where her followers hope to find themselves residing before or after their death.</li>
<li>Rituals: Many drow will pray to Slumbous before putting out their candles, lanterns, or light fixtures in order to receive a good night’s rest. They also believe bathing in the moon’s light gradually heals any physical or emotional trauma</li>
<li>Polotics: Slumbous is a figure of feminism and independence amongst the drow.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deitiesdrow">LU, OR THE-SEVERED-TIDES (she/her)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Ideals: Exuvium, Mania, and Dissociation</li>
    <li>Lore: Lu is the daughter of Slumbous and Hemolyck. After her mother’s death, she became so miserable that her skin shed and birthed a twin brother, Ciel. She has become blissfully jovial ever since.
    </li>
    <li>Polotics: The drow despise Lu as their culture emphasizes an acceptance of the self and camaraderie between one’s kin.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deitiesdrow">CIEL, OR THE-CRATERED-DESERT (he/him)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Ideals: Illness, Misery, and Desolation</li>
    <li>Lore: Ciel is the shedding of Lu, a manifestation of her past traumas. Little is known about him due to his shy nature, although many believe the sands of Najfielle are made from his skin, its mountains from his scabs, and its oases from his open wounds.
    </li>
    <li>Rituals: Lucille was once the most common girl name amongst the drow. Now, any drow with this name is considered a heretic, and “Lu” has become an insult equivalent to coward. However, you will meet many parents who named their son Ciel in hopes that their happiness will be acquired by the Cratered Sand’s.</li>

    <dd> and most humans in general, do not worship gods. This is not because they don’t believe in gods but rather because they believe gods are not worth worshiping. Rather, they speculate on different versions of the Afterdeath. Some believe those they kill will serve them in the Afterdeath. Others believe their good deeds will cause them to ascend into godhood. Others, mostly delusionist, believe there is no Afterdeath. At least, they hope there isn’t. Not if it was made by the gods who constructed the temporal world wherein there is no order nor choice, only infinite chaos.

    <dt id="races">Gnolls</dt>
    <dd>are agnostic. They understand that any religion they practice will deliver them into the jaws of its purgatory.
    </dd>
    <dt id="races">Qruku</dt>
    <dd>are atheistic. The persecution of their people has squandered their faith, and in only a few generations, no one can remember the names of the old gods.</dd>
    <dt id="races">Zahtai</dt>
    <dd>worship an ever-expanding pantheon, adopting the deities they encounter as their own. A tribe will typically align themselves with a single deity, but even then, most will choose a new deity every few years.
    </dd>
    <dt id="races">Players</dt>
    <dd>of these ancestries are encouraged to be flexible with their religion. With the exception of the aelfir and drow, most deities do not manifest themselves into avatars or through visions. If they do, they are the creation of a delusionist. Consider: Do you align with the rest of your ancestry, or are you a heretic? Maybe you want to aspire to godhood by killing all other gods, or maybe you are only interested in traveling to the Eight Heavens (this is common amongst deadwalkers). Whatever your beliefs are, they determine what your character desires, and the laws of this malefic landscape follow a single principle.<em><strong>Belief defines reality.</strong></em>
